This was my Honours project which was part of the last year of my degree.

During this project, I also contributed to a paper _[A Single-Significant-Digit Calculus for Semi-Automated Guesstimation](http://www.springerlink.com/content/3078725452426125/)_ which was presented at [IJCAR 2010](http://www.floc-conference.org/IJCAR-accepted.html).
