During the 3rd covid lockdown of 2020, I got slightly obssesed with Netflix Christmas Films.  I was disapponted to discover that no-one had started a wiki documenting them all, including in-universe lore and crossovers between films.  Therefore, I used my time stuck at home to correct this.

To begin with, this was a solo endeavour.  But in the summer of 2021, a friendly gent from Utah came across my wiki and had a similar passion for Christmas Movies as I do.  Since then, the wiki has been a collaborative affair.
