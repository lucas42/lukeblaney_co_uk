A selection of musical works composed between 2020 and 2022, in and around the time of stay-at-home orders being issued globally as a response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

A very limited run of paperback copies was printed in late 2022. It is also available [digitally as a pdf](/media/The%20Lockdown%20Compositions.pdf).
