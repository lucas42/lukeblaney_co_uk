A personal website, which introduces me and gives a few insights about stuff I've done.

Originally written as I was finishing university and starting looking for a job.  The first iteration was written in PHP and ran on a friend's server.  Later it was containerised, and in 2025 the backend was entirely rewritten to utilise Hugo - a golang based static site generator.  

My proudest part is the hover animation on the project thumbnails.  These were orginally added when CSS3 was still in draft and most didn't have a working implementation yet.  Over time, as browsers added support for more CSS3 features, different thumbnails began working without any change needed to site.  I know today these seem a tad cheesy, but I like the history of them, so I'm keeping them.  Also, the original site was written when I was going through my semantic web phase, so lots of key parts of the site are available in RDF.  Where possible, I've tried to keep these RDF version available, even though I doubt anyone uses them.
