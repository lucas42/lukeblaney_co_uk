To keep track of my travels, I have a corkboard map which I annotate with markings, pins and thread.  Unlike some other travel maps, mine focuses more on journeys taken, than places visited.  Journeys taken by land or sea are drawn on the map, colour coded by mode of transport.  Journeys taken by air are depicted by threads joining pins in the map.  The style of pin distingushes layovers from origin or destination airports.
