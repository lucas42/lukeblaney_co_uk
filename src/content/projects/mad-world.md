As a teenager, I recorded a cover of Mad World by Tears for Fears.  A version by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules had recently been played alot, following the release of the film Donnie Darko.

In it, I played various instruments, including guitar, tin whistle, traditional wooden flute, electric piano and concertina.  I also spoke the lyrics over the top, inspired by some cover songs William Shatner had done.
