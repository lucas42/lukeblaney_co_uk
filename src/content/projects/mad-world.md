As a teenager, I recorded a cover of Mad World by Tears for Fears.  (A version by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules had recently been played alot, following the release of the film Donnie Darko)  In it, I played various instruments, including guitar, tin whistle, traditional wooden flute, electric piano and concertina.  I also spoke the lyrics over the top, inspired by some cover songs William Shatner had done.
