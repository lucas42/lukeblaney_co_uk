Hi, I'm Luke.  Originally from Belfast, I'm now based in London, though have spent time living in France, Edinburgh and Tokyo too.

In my spare time, I'm a programmer, dancer, composer and traveller.  Some of the things I've done are listed on my [projects pages](/projects).

Professionally, I work in tech - most recently in cyber security.  You can get more deets on my [CV](/cv).
